About the installer:
The installer is going to help you set up your Sitecore development env by automatically set the below things up:
- IIS Website
- Install your license file
- Sitecore databases
- Install all modules specified in the config file

Instructions:
1. Open the settings.config file, modify it to suit your need and save it. Please make sure you double check all of the settings with [REQUIRED] label on top of it.

2. Extract the 7zip files (5 files) to get the installation package file (you need to point the "InstallationPackageFilePath" param in the settings.config to this file).

2. Open powershell console as admistrator.

3. Set the context of the execution to this folder.

4. Type .\ Install.ps1 and press enter.

5. Type Install and press enter.

6. Enter the password of your database administrator user when prompted.

7. If you have previously registered the Sitecore repository, then you might get an error, but the error should not stop the execution.

8. Get a cup of coffee/tea and watch the screen. The process will take a little bit of time due to database installation and modules installation (if any).
